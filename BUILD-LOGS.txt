[10:38:00.612] (!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification. Consider:
[10:38:00.612] - Using dynamic import() to code-split the application
[10:38:00.612] - Use build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks to improve chunking: https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-manualchunks
[10:38:00.612] - Adjust chunk size limit for this warning via build.chunkSizeWarningLimit.[39m
