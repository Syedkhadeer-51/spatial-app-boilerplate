[10:39:48.315] (!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification. Consider:
[10:39:48.315] - Using dynamic import() to code-split the application
[10:39:48.316] - Use build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks to improve chunking: https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-manualchunks
[10:39:48.316] - Adjust chunk size limit for this warning via build.chunkSizeWarningLimit.[39m
